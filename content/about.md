    <i class="user icon"></i> About Me
</h4>

I'm just a regular developer who is interested in technology/programming. I started my career with C#/.NET and sticked with it for the next 5 years (as some people can tell, I still love the language now even though I don't have much chance to use it at work).

Since joining ThoughtWorks, I have chance to explore a lot more other areas like frontend (React/React Native/Angular 1), backend (Ruby on Rails, NodeJS) or infrastructure and automation (Docker, Kubernetes, Istio, Ansible, Terraform, Packer, Bamboo CI etc).

I used to read up a lot on clean code, object oriented design, scalable software systems, domain driven design, CQRS, onion architecture, etc, hoping one day I have chance to work on a system handling billions of transactions.

At the moment my current interest is in infrastructure and automation (Kubernetes, Istio, Continuous Delivery etc).

<b>Coding</b>: I haven't done much coding outside of work nowadays. Instead I spend more time reading up technical books/articles or watching video training when I have some free time.

<b>Martial Arts</b>: I started learning Kungfu at the age of 11 since I was a tiny boy at that time. Over the years, I have tried several other martial arts like Karate, Muay Thai, Boxing but the one that I sticked to the longest is only Karate (Kyokushin style). And yes, that was me in the avatar (taken a long time ago).

<b>Gaming</b>: I'm not a hardcore gamer. In the past I used to play a lot of hack-and-slash games like Diablo, Titan Quest. At the moment I find myself enjoying turn-based strategy games like Heroes of Might and Magic 3, Disciples, Kings'Bounty more.
